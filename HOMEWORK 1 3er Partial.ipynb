What I mean by a ”process” is that I’ll give you a set of steps that you do in order but that you aren’t meant to be a slave to or that will totally always work for every problem. They are just a good starting point for many programming problems and shouldn’t be considered the only way to solve these types of problems. This process is just one way to do it that you can follow."
